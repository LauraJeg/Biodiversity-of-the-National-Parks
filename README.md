# Biodiversity-of-the-National-Parks

It was an open-ended exploratory data analysis project where I discovered patterns to the types of endangered species.

The .pdf file in this directory has the studies' conclusions.

----

### We were given two datasets; 

----

#### `species_info.csv` containing information on the different species in the National Parks with their conservation status.

With columns; 

- `category`
- `scientific_name`
- `common_name`
- `conservation_status`status

----

#### `observations.csv`; contains information from recorded sightings of different species over a seven-day period.

With columns; 

- `scientific_name` 
- `park_name`
- `observations`
This dataset was entirely fictional. 

Merging the two gave the opportunity to explore trends within `species_info.csv`

### Project Ideas

Four National Parks in the United States of America were represented.


### The focus of the project was biodiversity. 
#### I decided to centre my analysis on birds of prey both protected and non-protected.

----

Birds of prey, also known as raptors, are considered important 'indicator species' of biodiversity. They perform an important role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems by controlling populations of small mammals, reptiles and other birds. 

Raptors are top predators and occupy a high trophic level, making them sensitive to changes in the food web and in their prey populations. As such, changes in raptor populations can indicate shifts in ecosystem health and the presence of toxic substances, such as pesticides and heavy metals. 

Raptors require large territories and diverse habitats to survive making them effective indicators of the overall health of ecosystems. As species with a long lifespan and low reproductive rate, they are very sensitive to long-term environmental changes, such as habitat loss and degradation.
